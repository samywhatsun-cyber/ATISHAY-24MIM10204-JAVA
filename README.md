CSE2006 – Smart Academic Planner & Grade Predictor
📘 Overview

This project, developed as part of the CSE2006 course, implements a Java-based console application that assists students in managing multiple courses and assessments while predicting their academic performance.
It allows tracking of tests, assignments, and exams; computes current weighted grades; and forecasts required marks to achieve target grades — all through an intuitive, menu-driven interface.

🎯 Objectives

Enable students to record and manage courses.

Track assessments with their marks and weightages.

Calculate current grades dynamically.

Predict marks required to reach a target final grade.

Provide a consolidated semester summary.

✨ Key Features

Multi-Course Support: Add, list, and manage multiple courses.

Assessment Management: Add, update, and delete assessments per course.

Grade Calculation: Calculates weighted averages and completion progress.

Goal Prediction: Displays average marks required to reach a target score.

Summary Report: Provides an overview of progress across all courses.

Simple Console UI: Fully text-based interface that runs anywhere Java does.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Java (JDK 17 or newer)

Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Collections (ArrayList)
